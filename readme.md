## Why Laravel?

I have chosen to use Laravel as a framework because it is great for RAD and I had to build this application in a short time.

In order to run this application:

using composer
- install requirements

rename .env.example to .env

using php artisan:
- generate app key
- migrate to Database
- run artisan serve command
